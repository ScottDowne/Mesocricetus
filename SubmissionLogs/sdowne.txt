1. maze generation. Randomly generate an array of numbers to signify maze walls.
2. maze rendering. Read the array of ints generated by maze generation. Create objects out of that to draw box faces (both me and Grace worked on this, pair programming. I would say 50/50)
4. camera. Made the camera work like a first person shooter.
5. mouse keyboard controls. Made camera move to these keys WASD to move, mouse to look.
6. xInput. Made an xBox controller move the camera using xInput.
7. game timer. Simple HUD with some text displaying the time left to finish the maze.
8. collision. collision with maze walls.
9. 3D cricket sound at end of maze.
