Overview
========

We imagine building a 3D maze solving game. The player must successful navigate through the maze. The player will take the first person perspective of a hamster, playing the role of a laboratory rat hamster. The hamster will be equipped with a mining helmet complete with mining light.
Features

User controllers
----------------
The keyboard will be used for both navigation and other actions like jumping. The mouse will be used to change the direction the player's camera faces.
Jumping

When the character jumps, they will be able to see over the wall and kind of get an overhead view of the maze they are navigating.

Lights
------
As the player navigates through the maze, light from their mining helmet will fall on objects that the player is facing. Different areas of the maze will be lit differently with lights on the wall and shadows being cast appropriately

Breadcrumbs (markers)
---------------------
As the player navigates through the maze, they will have an option to leave a trial of breadcrumbs (markers) that can be used to retrace their movement in the maze. cast as expected.

Sound /3D Sound
---------------
Movement of the player will produce a sound that will be in time with the speed at which the player is navigating through the maze. The game will also make use of 3D sound for directional sound. For example if an object behind the player moves, the generated sound will appear to come from behind.

Obstacles
----------
There will be obstacles in the maze that the player must avoid in order to successful beat the maze. Some these may be a hand that picks the user up and moves them to the start position, holes in the floor that the user must jump, booby traps in the floor /walls, etc.
